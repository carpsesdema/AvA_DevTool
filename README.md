**Welcome to AvA DevTool!** üëã

AvA is your intelligent AI desktop partner, designed to assist with a variety of tasks. This project is a rebuild using **PySide6**, focusing on creating a modular, robust, and extensible application. Think of AvA as your evolving sidekick, ready to integrate with powerful AI models and streamline your workflows.

## üöÄ Vision

The goal is to build a versatile assistant that can:

*   Engage in intelligent conversations using various LLMs.
*   Assist with development tasks, including code generation and RAG-based context awareness.
*   Manage projects and chat sessions effectively.
*   Provide a clean, intuitive, and customizable user experience.
*   And much more as the project grows!

## üå± Current Status: Phase 1 - Core Chat & UI Foundation

We are currently in **Phase 1**, which lays the groundwork for AvA's capabilities.

**Key Features in Phase 1:**

*   **Modern UI Shell:** Built with PySide6, featuring a `MainWindow` with a `LeftPanel` for controls and a central chat display area.
*   **LLM Integration:**
    *   Support for multiple Large Language Models (LLMs) via a flexible `BackendCoordinator`.
    *   Default integration with **Gemini** for chat. (Support for Ollama & GPT adapters included).
    *   Basic streaming chat functionality for interactive conversations.
*   **Core Chat Functionality:**
    *   "New Chat" session creation.
    *   LLM selection from the `LeftPanel`.
    *   Configuration of AI persona/system prompt.
*   **Developer Tools:**
    *   `LLMCommunicationLog` dialog to inspect AI interactions.
    *   Rudimentary project and session management (persisted locally).
*   **Configuration:** API keys are loaded from a `.env` file for security.

**What's Not Yet Implemented (but on the horizon!):**

*   Advanced project context management or tabbed chat interfaces.
*   Full-fledged Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) system.
*   Agentic multi-file workflows (e.g., advanced code bootstrapping, automated file modifications).
*   Sophisticated UI elements like temperature sliders, token counters, etc.
*   Comprehensive session saving/loading beyond the basic current state.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started (Phase 1)

Follow these steps to get AvA up and running on your local machine:

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/carpsesdema/AvA_DevTool.git
    cd AvA_DevTool
    ```

2.  **Create a Virtual Environment:**
    (Recommended to keep dependencies isolated)
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    ```
    Activate it:
    *   On Windows: `venv\Scripts\activate`
    *   On macOS/Linux: `source venv/bin/activate`

3.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Set Up API Keys:**
    Create a `.env` file in the project root directory (`AvA_DevTool/`). Add your API keys like this:
    ```env
    # Required for Gemini (default chat LLM)
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"

    # Optional: For OpenAI's GPT models
    # OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY_HERE"

    # Note: Ollama runs locally and typically doesn't require an API key in the .env
    ```
    Replace `"YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"` with your actual Gemini API key.

5.  **Run the Application:**
    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

AvA should now launch! üéâ

## ‚ú® Future Phases

AvA is an evolving project. Future phases aim to introduce:

*   **Enhanced RAG Capabilities:** Deeper integration with local files and knowledge bases.
*   **Agentic Workflows:** For more complex task automation and code generation.
*   **Improved UI/UX:** Tabbed chats, advanced configuration options, and a more polished interface.
*   **Plugin System:** To extend AvA's functionality.

Stay tuned for updates!
